# Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of **small projects** I work on in my free time to keep my programming skills sharp, explore new technologies, and experiment with ideas. Each project is organized into its own folder with its code, dependencies, and instructions.

## Current Projects

- **Emotion Detection**: Real-time emotion detection using **FER** and **OpenCV**. Detects emotions on faces from a webcam feed and displays the emotion with a confidence score.

> More projects will be added over time as I continue learning and experimenting.
